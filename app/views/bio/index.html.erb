<h4>Basics</h4>
<p>Born 24 years ago in Texas, now in Pennsylvania. I'm a life-long geek, aspiring to learn and achieve everything I can
as a developer. My primary interest is in web and mobile applications, and I'm making progress in adding to my technical toolbox.
I'm a musician, enjoying a broad range of genres and styles, and like to unwind by practicing either my music or my programming.</p>
<h4>Education</h4>
<p>I graduated Highschool in 2011. In 2012, I started community college, studying toward an associates degree in nursing. 
After a time of reflection and reevaluation of my goals, I made the move to get into the IT and Development Field.
Having been a tech-nut my entire life,
it felt natural. I then moved to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity from Kaplan university Online. 
It was during this round that I decided Development was more my style.
I've switched majors to Mobile Applications Software Engineering and will begin those courses in the fall.</p>
